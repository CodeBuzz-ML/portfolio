            This Project is created for automating the process of report cards of a school. Even though, popular and rich schools have many such systems, small schools with a low fees lack such systems.
            <br>
            So, I have made this project in VB.NET, one of the common but old programming languages for making GUI Based Windows Applications. 
            As told earlier, I would not be giving away the code of this project but I would like to show it's features and capablities.
            Also, for using this project, you need to install crystal reports redistributable library
            
            <h2>Demonstration</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As soon as you open your application, you will have to login with your credentials as shown below.</p><br>
            <img src="imgLogin.png" alt="Login Page Image" >
            <p>After you enter the credentials, you will see a simple dashboard with some fields.</p><br>
            <img src="imgDashboard.png" alt="Dashboard Image" height="312" class="center"><hr width="312"><br>
            <p>You are then supposed to populate the fields according to their names</p><br>
            <img src="imgPopFields.png" alt="Dashboard Image" height="312" class="center"><hr width="312"><br>
            <p>At last, you clik on the generate report card button. It will then show you a report card preview besides and will also give you options to print, save, export the report card etc.</p>
