            Hello and Welcome everyone!
            This project is one of my masterpieces for me. So I really like this project.
            Let us quickly take a short ride before going in too deep.
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                We all know how important the spaceships in today’s technological world are. Spaceships are deployed in the
                space for the various critical missions. Usually, all the space missions are extremely costly, and the success and
                the failure of such missions greatly lies in the health of the spaceship itself.
                The biggest challenge for the spaceships deployed for critical space missions, is to avoid asteroids and other
                debris in the space.
                Even though the latest cutting-edge technologies can easily handle this problem, it is not very economical. The
                current technologies work with a camera and AI to prevent collisions with debris and asteroids in the space.
                However, as expensive as it sounds, this technology is not affordable.
                Also because of the new spaceships’ enormous technology costs a fortune, this adds up to the amount.
                This calls for an affordable solution.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>
                I have tried to overcome the above problem with an idea that gives rise to a working model. I have named the 
                device as OSCAS (Outer Space Collision Avoiding System). The idea is original, and the design and solution is 
                solely thought and implemented by me. 
            </p>
            <h2>Project Description and Working</h2>
            <p>
                The OSCAS, uses Ultrasound Object Detection Technology, instead of a Camera and AI unlike other devices to 
                make it cost efficient. 
                Diagram 1.1 below, shows the Spaceship and Ultrasound Sensors mounted on it.
                Also, making a note of the ultrasonic sensors, I have used only one of them in my physical model which I will show you in some time. But as thoght out, we can also use three of the sensors in the model.

            <strong>The OSCAS Works on the principle of travel of sound </strong>
                <p>
                    The OSCAS consists of three Ultrasound (US) sensors that are mounted on the spaceship. These sensors transmit and receive sound waves that a human ear cannot perceive. When the transmitted sound waves collide on any object in their path, they reflect and are received back by the US sensors mounted on the spaceship. The US sensors then pass the information to the code about the distance between the object and the sensor.<br><br>  Next, the Arduino uno (the brain of the project) processes the information by received from all three US sensors and graphs it into a radar like interface for human convenience. It also consists of some LED bulbs indicating the distance between the object and the spaceship. The US sensor 1 and 2 are mounted on servo motors, so they keep on rotating and are responsible to detect the hurdles on the either side of the spaceship.  US Sensor 3 is mounted in the Centre and is responsible to track the objects/hurdles coming from the front.

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            
                <ul >
                    <li>○ Less Complex Architecture</li>
                    <li>○ Highly cost effective </li>
                    <li>○ Solves major issues related to the mankind in todays technological world </li>
                    <li>○ Robust</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            <h2>Points Worth Noting</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>○ Ultrasonic waves used in the prototype model can be replaced with high range signals like laser</li>
                <li>○ Microcontroller Arduino Uno used fort this prototype can be replaced by high end controllers for the large-scale projects </li>
            </ul><br>
            <h2>Economic Viablity</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>○ The project is highly viable economically considering that the current technologies are very costly.</li>
                <li>○ The prototype is also economic as it uses only few electronic components</li>
            </ul>
